      <p>The Snake game is a classic video game where players control a snake that moves around a board, collecting food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with walls, obstacles, or its own tail. The game increases in difficulty as the snake grows, limiting available space and requiring precise navigation. Points are earned by eating food, and the game ends when the snake crashes. Originally popularized in the 1970s arcade game Blockade and later gaining iconic status on Nokia phones in the late 1990s, the Snake game remains a timeless and addictive favorite, inspiring countless variations and modern adaptations.</p>

      <p>Tic Tac Toe is a simple, two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Each player takes turns marking a space in the grid with their symbol, either an "X" or an "O." The objective is to be the first to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. If all nine spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw. Known for its straightforward rules and quick gameplay, Tic Tac Toe is a classic game often used to teach the basics of strategy and planning.</p>

      <p>Creating a calculator is a fundamental project that helps train coding skills by covering essential programming concepts like arithmetic operations, user input handling, conditional statements, and loops. It offers a hands-on way to practice writing clean, efficient code and debugging errors. Additionally, building a calculator provides experience with user interface design if it's graphical, or with command-line interaction if it's text-based. This project reinforces problem-solving skills and can be scaled in complexity by adding features like scientific functions, memory storage, or error handling, making it a versatile and educational coding exercise.</p>
