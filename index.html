      <p>Tetris is a classic puzzle game created by Alexey Pajitnov in 1984, where players arrange falling tetrominoes—shapes made of four blocks—on a grid to form complete horizontal lines, which then disappear. The game speeds up as players progress, requiring quick thinking and precision to prevent the stack from reaching the top, which results in a game over. Players can move and rotate pieces, and modern versions introduce features like a hold queue, ghost pieces, and advanced scoring techniques like T-Spins and combos. With its simple yet deep mechanics, Tetris remains one of the most iconic and enduring video games ever made.</p>

      <p>The Snake game is a classic video game where players control a snake that moves around a board, collecting food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with walls, obstacles, or its own tail. The game increases in difficulty as the snake grows, limiting available space and requiring precise navigation. Points are earned by eating food, and the game ends when the snake crashes. Originally popularized in the 1970s arcade game Blockade and later gaining iconic status on Nokia phones in the late 1990s, the Snake game remains a timeless and addictive favorite, inspiring countless variations and modern adaptations.</p>

      <p>Tic Tac Toe is a simple, two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Each player takes turns marking a space in the grid with their symbol, either an "X" or an "O." The objective is to be the first to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. If all nine spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw. Known for its straightforward rules and quick gameplay, Tic Tac Toe is a classic game often used to teach the basics of strategy and planning.</p>

      <img src="img/calc.png" alt="calculator" class="project-img">
      <p>Creating a calculator is a fundamental project that helps train coding skills by covering essential programming concepts like arithmetic operations, user input handling, conditional statements, and loops. It offers a hands-on way to practice writing clean, efficient code and debugging errors. Additionally, building a calculator provides experience with user interface design if it's graphical, or with command-line interaction if it's text-based. This project reinforces problem-solving skills and can be scaled in complexity by adding features like scientific functions, memory storage, or error handling, making it a versatile and educational coding exercise.</p>

      <p>Cigarettes After Sex is an ambient pop band formed in 2008 by vocalist and songwriter Greg Gonzalez in El Paso, Texas, known for their dreamy, atmospheric sound and introspective lyrics. Blending minimalist arrangements, reverb-heavy guitars, and slow tempos, their music creates a cinematic, melancholic experience often described as a mix of ambient pop, shoegaze, and slowcore. Gonzalez’s androgynous, whispery vocals complement the band’s deeply personal lyrics, which explore themes of love, desire, heartbreak, and fleeting intimacy with vivid imagery. Their breakout EP I. (2012), featuring Nothing’s Gonna Hurt You Baby, and subsequent albums Cigarettes After Sex (2017) and Cry (2019) have cemented their reputation for creating intimate, nostalgic music. With a minimalist aesthetic and global fanbase, the band’s songs, such as Apocalypse and K, frequently appear in films, TV shows, and playlists for late-night reflection or romantic introspection, solidifying their unique place in modern indie and ambient pop music.</p>

      <p>TV Girl is an indie pop band formed in 2010 in San Diego, California, by Brad Petering, Jason Wyman, and Wyatt Harmon, known for their lo-fi production, catchy melodies, and witty, bittersweet lyrics. Their music blends elements of indie pop, hip-hop, and 1960s-inspired sample-based production, creating a nostalgic yet fresh sound characterized by breezy beats and lush instrumentation. Themes of love, heartbreak, and disillusionment are delivered with a playful, satirical edge, often exploring the darker, more ironic sides of relationships. Their 2014 debut album, French Exit, featuring fan favorites like Lovers Rock and Birds Don’t Sing, gained a cult following, and subsequent releases, including Who Really Cares (2016) and Death of a Party Girl (2018), further solidified their reputation for crafting emotionally resonant yet tongue-in-cheek songs.
